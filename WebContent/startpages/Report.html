		<h2> SQL To Create Databases </h2>
		<h3> Member Database Table</h3>
		<pre> 
				 CREATE TABLE ILMemberDatabase
				 (FirstName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
				 Surname varchar(255) NOT NULL,
				 Username varchar(30) NOT NULL,
				 Password varchar(30) NOT NULL,
				 Primary key (Username))
		</pre>
		<h3> Staff Database Table </h3>
		<pre> 
				 CREATE TABLE ILStaffDatabase
				 (FirstName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
				 Surname varchar(255) NOT NULL,
			 	 StaffID integer NOT NULL,
			 	 Password varchar(30) NOT NULL,
			 	 Primary key (StaffID))
		</pre>
		<h3> Book Keeping Table (Holds Records for Members) </h3>
		<pre>
				CREATE TABLE ILBookKeeping
				(MemberName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
				PastCurrentReservations varchar(1000) NOT NULL,
				BorrowDate varchar(255) NOT NULL,
				ExpiryDate varchar(255) NOT NULL,
				Constraint C1 Foreign key (MemberName)
				ILMemberDatabase (Username))
		</pre>
		
		<h3> Table for Library Catalogue </h3>
		<pre>
				CREATE TABLE ILCatalogue
				(Author varchar(255) NOT NULL,
				Title varchar(255) NOT NULL,
				PublishYear integer(4) NOT NULL,
				BookID integer(30) NOT NULL,
				Primary key (BookID))
		</pre>
		 

		<h3> Member Functionality</h3>
		<pre>
1) There is an option to sign in as six different members. Each member has a unique account once they are logged in.
   A welcome message is presented to the member on their account. This welcome message retrieves the first name
   and surname associated with the username in the ILMemberDatabase and presents the information to the member. 
   The current time is also included in this welcome message. 
   
2) Once the member is logged into their account, they can see Books that they have either previously taken out or currently
   are taking out. The borrow date and expiry date of these books is also displayed. The username is obtained from the MemberLoginServlet 
   and forwarded to the MemberAccountServlet. The MemberAccountInfo java bean is created to create objects which can be used to get and set
   information from the ILBookKeeping database. An empty ArrayList of objects is created in the MemberAccountServlet. An object is created 
   for each row in the ILBookKeeping database. Each object has the following setAttributes associated with that username - 
   PASTCURRENTRESERVATIONS, BORROWDATE,EXPIRYDATE. The object ArrayList is then forwarded to the Member Account Page (MemberAccount.jsp), where 
   a foreach tag is used to iterate through the Object Arraylist and display the three set attributes in their respective columns in the table
   on the MemberAccount.jsp page as soon as the member has logged in. JSTL is used for this element. 
	</pre>

		<h3> Staff Member Functionality</h3>
	<pre>
1) When a staff member is assigning a book to a member in the library (StaffAssignBooks.jsp), the borrow date is automatically
   set as the current date in the Servlet. This date is presented in the following format (dd/mm/yyyy) for the database record 
   (cannot be changed by staff member) and validation is done on the expiry date in the form. The expiry date must be in the form (dd/mm/yyyy).
   Regular expressions within the 'pattern' of the text input of the expiry date enable the validation. The regular expression covers
   leap years and the correct number of days in each month (For example - the 31st February 2020 cannot be chosen). 
   The regular expressions within the pattern also ensure that only the (/) symbol is accepted in between the date, month and year.
   (dd-mm-yyyy) or (dd.mm.yyyy) are not accepted.
   
2) When a staff member is changing the expiry dates of a book on a member's account (StaffChangeExpiryDates.jsp), the staff 
   member must enter a USERNAME, PASTCURRENTRESERVATIONS, BORROWDATE and EXPIRYDATE which matches a single row in the database. 
   If any of these fields are incorrect within that row, an error message will appear saying that the record is not found. 
   </pre>
   
   		<h3> Catalogue Functionality </h3>
   	<pre>
   The catalogue page is available to anyone who accesses the website (Catalogue.jsp). The user searches by Author or Title. 
   The user can search partial words, such as elec, control and any row in the database which contains these words is displayed
   to the user. This functionality is implemented in a similar way to the Member Account Page. An arraylist of objects is 
   created here also. The for each tag in the Catalogue.jsp page is used to iterate through the Object ArrayList and display
   the four set attributes of the Object (AUTHOR, TITLE, PUBLISHYEAR, BOOKID). JSTL is also used for this element. If the search
   term is not contained within any of the author or title columns of the database, the user is prompted with a message saying that
   this record was not found. 
    </pre>
    
    	<h3> Bonus Features </h3>
	<pre> 
1) User validation occurs at login for both the staff members and library members (StaffLogin.jsp and MemberLogin.jsp).
   If login details do not match database records, login is not possible.		
   
2) When the library member or staff member logs out, their session is invalidated in the LogoutServlet and they are sent back to the
   start page ()LibraryStartPage.jsp). This should remove all the data in the session if the user was to try and get back in. By default
   the cache stores all of the responses and thus the back button displays the page from the browser cache instead of requesting
   a brand new page from the Server,but the idea behind invalidating sessions on logout is correct.

3) All fields within all forms have to be filled/Selected in order to progress to the next page (MemberLogin.jsp, StaffLogin.jsp, 
   StaffAccount.jsp, StaffAssignBooks.jsp, StaffChangeExpiryDates.jsp, NewMember.jsp). This is implemented using the required attribute.
   
4) Session Tracking is enabled within this application. HTTP session is used for this. This is enabled in the MemberLoginServlet
   and StaffLoginServlet. New sessions are created here and the maximum inactive interval of 10 minutes is set. The staff member and
   library member are logged out after ten minutes if they are inactive. The Member Login session is carried to the next member 
   servlet (MemberAccountServlet). The Staff Login Session is carried to the next set of staff servlets 
   (StaffAccountServlet, StaffAssignBooksServlet, StaffChangeExpiryDatesServlet).
   
5) There is a registration feature available on LibraryStartPage which allows users to join Imaginary Library (NewMember.jsp). 
   At registration, a unique username is required to register. If the user tries to choose a username already taken by another
   member, they are prompted that this username is taken and that they need to pick another username. 
   A password strength checker is implemented within this registration form. This password strength checker is implemented using
   JQuery. This feature implements AJAX as in page replacement is used to illustrate the strength of the users' password while they type.
